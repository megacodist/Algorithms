### **Dijkstra's Algorithm**
A classic and powerful algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a weighted graph. It forms the conceptual basis for many real-world routing and network optimization problems.

## Our Philosophy

This knowledge base adheres to three core principles:

*   **Clarity Over Brevity:** Explanations are written to be understood, not just to be concise. We unpack the "why" behind the "how."
*   **Practical Code:** Every algorithm is accompanied by a clean, commented, and practical implementation in a modern programming language.
*   **First Principles:** We build complex ideas from simple foundations, ensuring no logical leaps are left unexplained.
